# The Three Mind Classes
There are 3 classes of mind which everyone can be placed into.

# Class A
These are born leaders.
People who can carry a group and be a genuinely good leader.
Maybe not a popular leader, though they most likely will be, but a good leader.

Qualities:
- Good leadership, or at least strong ability to work with a team.
- Strong force on most dynamics if not all.
- It takes quite a bit to defeat them.
- Can handle life even through the some of the most trying of times.

# Class B
What you'd call your average "work-a-day man" who at least somewhat has his stuff together.
When assigned to leadership roles, they can handle it to some degree, but they will not be a great leader. (Though it depends on Dyn 3 Force mostly.)

Most people fall into this category.

Qualities:
- A Fair degree of force on most dynamics.
- Is able to handle life, even if its a bit overwhelming at times.
- it takes a fair amount to get them to stop their effort for their goals IF they've set their mind to it.

# Class C
You often find this class of mind in assisted living facilities.
They cannot handle life by themselves.

An example of this is a child who maybe even looks happy and aware.
But when you look at how they behave, they are not very aware. And infact, they may not care much about anything around them (Apathetic)

Qualities:
- Doesn't work with teams well.
- Doesn't think to a great degree, as a Class B or Class A would.
- Not persistent towards goals, feels overwhelmed at small stops or barriers.
- Cannot handle life without outside help.
