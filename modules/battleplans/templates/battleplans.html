      <h3>What is a Battle Plan?</h3>
      <p>Shorthand: BP</p>
      <p>
        A Battle Plan is, basically, a to-do list for your workday,
        including what metrics you need to hit to do well.
        <br><br>
        The idea is that you write what you need to do, and when it needs to happen by, 
        and then you do it. And Additionally, in tracking the quota you need to hit, you plan
        your BP around hitting that goal. In addition to anything else irrelevant that you may need to do.
        <br><br>
        Note: This is a interpretation of the concept,
        and I do not claim that this is how Scientology says it should be done.
        This is merely how I do it for my own productivity.
      </p>
      <h3>Why "Battle plan"?</h3>
      <p>
        This specific concept of a to-do list originates from
        Scientology text, titled "Battle Plans" by L. Ron Hubbard
        and its name has its roots in early colloquial Scientology terminology.
        <br><br>
        Presumably, this is because you are "battling" the day to get it all done.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, this slang term was not intended to be taken literally, no matter how apt it is.
        Nor was the word made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is merely a term that stuck, especially after he
        addressed Battle Plans in his writings regarding Church policy about productivity.
      </p>
      <h3>Must I use the quotas?</h3>
      <p>
        No, But it may be useful. Even if you don't think you have a quota to hit, you still have several
        tasks to complete, right? Maybe your quota can be "I need to get all 7 of my tasks done today"
        (By setting "Need quota for today" to 7, and "Quota reached today" to 0 at the start of the day).
